## Description
If it were up to me the subfield delimiters would fight Highlander style and there would be only one. But that's not the case so I built this. A simple app that lets you submit a string of MARC text and will print out each delimiter type. Handy for stuff like copying headings from OCLC and pasting them into Alma. Please get into contact if you see a bug or your catalog as a delimiter that isn't on my list.
